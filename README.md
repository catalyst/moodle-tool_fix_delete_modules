# Fix Delete Modules #

![GitHub Workflow Status (branch)](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/catalyst/moodle-tool_fix_delete_modules/ci/main)

Plugin used to check and resolve any incomplete course_delete_module adhoc tasks.

This has been tested to cover the following course_delete_module adhoc task failure scenarios:
- course_module table record absent.
- module's table (e.g. quiz) record absent.
- context table record absent.
- **course module flagged with `deletioninprogress=1` but no matching adhoc task in the queue ("orphaned" course module).**

## Check ##
- If the task(s) contains multiple course modules, it will recommend
  separating each module into separate adhoc tasks. See "Resolve" for more
  information.
- If there is/are task(s) which are incomplete, it will identify which database
  tables lack records, which cause the breakdown for the normal process deleting
  course modules. For example, the course module record or the assign table
  record might be missing. See "Resolve" for information about how the plugin
  can resolve these.
- If there are **orphaned course modules** — rows in `course_modules` flagged
  with `deletioninprogress=1` but with no matching `course_delete_modules`
  adhoc task in the queue — the plugin will list them in a separate "Orphaned
  course modules" section. This can happen when a worker process is killed
  mid-execute (for example by a worker time-out, OOM, or container restart)
  before the framework can mark the task as failed, leaving the cm flagged
  but no longer queued.

## Resolve ##
- Separate "clustered" adhoc tasks:
  If the adhoc task contains multiple modules, the plugin can separate them into
  individualised adhoc tasks (one per course module) so that modules without
  issue can be resolved as normal course_delete_module adhoc tasks. Any
  remaining tasks which have issues can be checked and resolved on their own.
- Delete remnant module data and clear off adhoc tasks:
  If a task is incomplete, the plugin can delete the remnant data records
  and clear off the course_delete_adhoc task. Although this process will NOT
  backup the module to the recycle bin.
- Re-queue orphaned course modules:
  For each orphaned cm (and the bulk action for all of them), the plugin
  re-queues a fresh `course_delete_modules` adhoc task via Moodle's standard
  `course_delete_module($cmid, true)` helper. This is the same code path the
  activity Delete button uses, so all normal deletion hooks, observers and
  events fire as expected. The next cron run completes the deletion as normal.

## GUI and CLI ##
There is a GUI side and a CLI to the plugin.

### GUI ###
There is a config setting to filter out any tasks with a very low
"faildelay" status. For example, if the task has a faildelay of 0, it's
probably doesn't need to be viewed.

### CLI ###
The "faildelay" filter can also be modified via a param.
Instructions of how to use the CLI can be found in the help page:

    $ php admin/tool/fix_delete_modules/cli/fix_course_delete_modules.php --help

The CLI also supports the orphan-cm scan via the `--requeue-orphans` flag:

    $ # List orphaned course modules without making changes:
    $ php admin/tool/fix_delete_modules/cli/fix_course_delete_modules.php --requeue-orphans

    $ # Re-queue them via course_delete_module() so cron will complete the deletion:
    $ php admin/tool/fix_delete_modules/cli/fix_course_delete_modules.php --requeue-orphans --fix

## Installing manually ##

The plugin can be also installed by putting the contents of this directory to

    {your/moodle/dirroot}/admin/tool/fix_delete_modules

Afterwards, log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
Notifications_ to complete the installation.

Alternatively, you can run

    $ php admin/cli/upgrade.php

to complete the installation from the command line.

## Configuration
- minimumfaildelay defines the minimum faildelay (in seconds) of
  course_delete_modules adhoc tasks to be displayed in the report page.
